# Job Analysis Project

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Job Analysis Project. This project is all about exploring job market trends using LinkedIn job postings data from 2024. It started as a learning project to get hands-on with data analysis and visualization and eventually turned into a web app using Django.

## About the Project

The idea behind this project was to dig into LinkedIn job data to uncover insights on hiring trends, salary patterns, and top locations for job seekers. I started by analyzing data in Jupyter Notebook, using tools like Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Then, I took things up a notch by building a Django app to make everything interactive and accessible as a web app.

### What You’ll Find Here

- **Hiring Trends** 📈: Find out when companies are hiring most.
- **Salary Insights** 💵: Compare average salaries across different industries and roles.
- **Top Locations** 🌍: See which cities have the most job postings and competitive pay.
- **Company Analysis** 🏢: Check out metrics on company size, job postings, and follower count.
- **Job Posting Dynamics** 📊: Discover patterns in job description length, work types, and applications.

## Getting Started

If you’d like to explore this project yourself, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-analysis-project.git
    cd job-analysis-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Django server**:

    ```

Then just open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser, and you’re good to go!
